    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>Inside the black box there are a series of tubes that allow the water to flow around the box and to come in and out. </p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>When running the trails on the original black box to get our data and our inspections of it , we learned that it could take 500ml and only 200 would come out. This black box is what we need to create so we kept running trails on the mystery black box to give us ideas on what to do with our box. Then we had an idea to create a series of tubes and loops to try and mimic the black box. WHich actual kinda showed us the way that the black box works, our theory was that water was being stored sometimes a little would come out but sometimes way more would come out </p>
