    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>Inside the black box there are a series of tubes that allow the water to flow around the box and to come in and out. </p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>When running the trails on the original black box to get our data and our inspections of it , we learned that it could take 500ml and only 200 would come out. This black box is what we need to create so we kept running trails on the mystery black box to give us ideas on what to do with our box. Then we had an idea to create a series of tubes and loops to try and mimic the black box. WHich actual kinda showed us the way that the black box works, our theory was that water was being stored sometimes a little would come out but sometimes way more would come out </p>
    <h1>Reasoning<h1> 
    <h3>Reasoning, Part 1<h3>
    <p>A model that is a knock off of the original black box that allowed us to know what was going on inside the black box.<p>
  <h3>Reasoning, Part 2<h3> 
    <p>My evidence supports my claim because when we tested our models , our results came back fairly similar to those of the black box. <p>
    <h3>Reasoning, Part 3<h3>
    <p>The data would have been more different if there was a different way that the water was being dispensed ,leading to different amounts of water that would come out, such as if there were no forms of tubing and the water was directed in a straight line.<p>
      <h1>Graph Table Data<h1>
        <p>Trial 1: 100mL Water / 28mL Water<p>
      <p>Trial 2: 100 mL Water / 77 mL Water<p>
      <p>Trial 3: 100mL Water / 95 mL Water<p>
      <p>Trial 4:  950 mL Water / 800 ml Water<p>
      <p>Trial 5: 700 mL Water / 620 mL water<p>
      <p>Trial 6: 300 mL Water / 300 mL Water<p>
      <p>Trial 7: 500 mL Water / 560 mL Water<p>
      <h2>Qualitative / Quantitative Keen Details:<h2>
        <p>We noticed that the higher amount of water that we inserted then led to less water that came out, but if we added less water then more came out, and that is due to the stored water that is in the box, after each trial the stored water in the tubing and it took more water, when inserted, to fully leave the tubing. We had an even point where we inserted 300 mL of water and got exactly back 300 mL.<p>
